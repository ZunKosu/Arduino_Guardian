# Arduino_BabyChair
一个编程都没学过的艺术生的毕业设计...  <Br/>
本科产品设计系的毕业设计  <Br/>
实物是一个带有提醒儿童滞留功能的汽车安全座椅  <Br/>
个人仅花几天的时间从网络中公开的资源里摘抄拼凑出了这个程序  <Br/>
程序逻辑完全是一条直线式的，实际不能很好的工作，目的是为了应付毕业设计展。  <Br/>

  <Br/>
An art student who has never learned programming...  <Br/>
Graduation Project of Industrial Design.  <Br/>
The real thing is a car seat which can warn that is the child still stranded in the car.  <Br/>
It took only a few days for individuals to piece together the program from the resources exposed in the network.  <Br/>
Program logic is completely linear.Actually can't work very well, the purpose is just to cope with the graduation design exhibition.  <Br/>
