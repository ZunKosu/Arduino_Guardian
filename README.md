# Arduino_BabyChair
一个编程都没学过的艺术生的毕业设计...
本科产品设计系的毕业设计
实物是一个带有提醒儿童滞留功能的汽车安全座椅
个人仅花几天的时间从网络中公开的资源里摘抄拼凑出了这个程序
程序逻辑完全是一条直线式的，实际不能很好的工作，目的是为了应付毕业设计展。


An art student who has never learned programming...
Graduation Project of Industrial Design
The real thing is a car seat which can warn that is the child still stranded in the car.
It took only a few days for individuals to piece together the program from the resources exposed in the network.
Program logic is completely linear.Actually can't work very well, the purpose is just to cope with the graduation design exhibition.
